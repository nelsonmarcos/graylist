#FAQ#

_1 - Why you don't have authentication on your mongodb?_<br>
**_Answer:_** Right now I'm learning how to use mongodb. Definitely I'll fix that.

_2 - Where are your tests?_<br>
**_Answer:_** I REALLY value tests and TDD but I'm not a programmer. I'm a sysdmin/devops improving
my programming skills. TDD is on my roadmap.

_3 - But you can write at least unit tests without TDD. It's pretty easy._<br>
**_Answer:_** I agree but to see the application running is more motivating than writing tests. 
Am I right? Not sure but that is my feeling right now.
 
_4 - Can I open issues?_<br>
**_Answer:_** Sure, I'll be more than glad listen to you.

_5 - Can I send pull requests?_<br>
**_Answer:_** Yes, BUT I'm not sure how I'll handle it. Since this project is for learning how to
program and create something useful, if you fix a lot of things at once or send things I don't
understand may be I'll try to code it myself so I can learn more about it.

_6 - Is that all?_<br>
**_Answer:_** For while yes. Feel free to contact me.
